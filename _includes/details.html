<p> The Purple is beautiful 1944 Cape Cod style house owned by a couple currently
living in Vancouver,BC.  <br/>The Purple now seeks a new family.</p>

<!--
<p>
                  We are renting out our home because we are moving to Canada.
                  Jacob accepted a job working on a coworking project in Vancouver, BC and Katie is always up for an adventure.
                  We've owned this house since 2004 and it has been well loved.  We are hoping to find the perfect family for this next
                  chapter of this amazing purple house.

The Purple has quite a bit of infrastructure packed into its 5000 sf lot.   We have a move-in ready chicken coop,
nice front porch, vegetable gardens and plenty of mature landscaping.
The backyard has a big deck and a lovely antique stone patio.
 There is a pathway around the house and a storage shed for all of your gardening needs.  And even a tree house!

In what we like to call “The Lower East Side of Ballard,” the Purple is walking distance from Fremont,
Ballard, and the Burke-Gilman trail.   It is also walking distance to several grocery stores, restaurants,
shops, and breweries.   It is just a few blocks from the 28 and 40 bus lines and quite bikeable.
