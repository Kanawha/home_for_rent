description: The Purple has quite a bit of infrastructure packed into its 5000 sf lot. We have a move-in ready chicken coop, nice front porch, vegetable gardens and plenty of mature landscaping. The backyard has a big deck and a lovely antique stone patio. There is a pathway around the house and a storage shed for all of your gardening needs. And even a tree house!
