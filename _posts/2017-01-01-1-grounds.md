    caption: The back patio was a wedding gift from a close friend of ours.  The stone is antique french granite, imported for the Schultz family until they wanted something new.  Ask us for the longer story, it's amazing.

    caption: The Tree House!  This is not a "play structure" for kids.  This is 18 feet off the ground.  The ladder retracts to deter little ones.

description: The Purple has quite a bit of infrastructure packed into its 5000 sf lot. We have a move-in ready chicken coop, nice front porch, vegetable gardens and plenty of mature landscaping. The backyard has a big deck and a lovely antique stone patio. There is a pathway around the house and a storage shed for all of your gardening needs. And even a tree house!
